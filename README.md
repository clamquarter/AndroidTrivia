# AndroidTrivia

AndroidTrivia is a small project I did as part of my CIS 217 course. It's a very simple app that randomizes quiz questions about Android development/Kotlin. The tutorial can be found in the Google Developers learning path here at https://developers.google.com/profile/badges/playlists/android/android-development-with-kotlin-6. The main goals of this project were:

<ul>
<li>Understanding fragments.</li>
<li>Learning to build out navigation in Android apps.</li>
<li>Implementing a Share feature for users to share their results.</li>
</ul>



<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Safe Args plugin generates classes for type-safe access to arguments.</li>
<li>Fragments are modular pieces of code that can be reused.</li>
<li>The Safe Args plugin does <b>not</b> prevent you from using the erong key. (learned the hard way)</li>
<li>I learned how to randomize data displayed to the UI.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I'd Do Differently</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a longer, more fun quiz.</li>
<li>Finish implementing the Share function.</li>
<li>Take better notes on my progress.</li>
</ul>
